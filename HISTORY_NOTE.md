# Repository History Note

## Security Sanitization - October 6, 2025

This repository underwent a security review and sanitization on October 6, 2025.

### What Was Changed

All hardcoded sensitive information has been replaced with placeholders in the latest commit (`9f61373` and forward):

- **Domain names**: Replaced `goloka.no-ip.biz` → `YOUR_DOMAIN`
- **IP addresses**: Replaced `192.168.0.199` → `YOUR_SERVER_IP`
- **Enhanced .gitignore**: Added comprehensive patterns to prevent future exposure

### Historical Context

Commits prior to `9f61373` (Security: Replace hardcoded domain/IPs with placeholders) may contain references to:
- Domain name (used for DNS/SSL configuration)
- Private IP addresses (192.168.x.x - local network only)
- Standard application ports (8000, 8765, 80, 443)

**Important**: No API keys, passwords, authentication tokens, or other credentials were ever committed to this repository. All secrets are properly stored in `.env` files which are gitignored.

### Risk Assessment

The information in historical commits poses **minimal security risk**:

- ✅ **Private IP addresses** (192.168.x.x) only work on local networks
- ✅ **Domain names** are publicly resolvable anyway (needed for DNS/SSL)
- ✅ **Standard ports** are industry-standard and not sensitive
- ✅ **No credentials** were ever exposed

### Current Status

✅ The current version of the repository is **fully sanitized** and uses only placeholders.

✅ All documentation now uses `YOUR_DOMAIN` and `YOUR_SERVER_IP` for user customization.

✅ Enhanced `.gitignore` prevents future accidental commits of sensitive data.
