# Security Fixes Applied

## Summary

Your repository had **domain names and local IP addresses** in documentation files that were being committed to GitHub. While the local IP (YOUR_SERVER_IP) is not a security risk since it's a private network address, exposing your domain name and showing your network setup is not ideal.

## What Was Found

### ✅ Safe (Private IP - Not a Security Risk)
- **YOUR_SERVER_IP** - This is a private IP address only accessible on your local network
- Standard application ports (8000, 8765, 80, 443) - These are normal and safe to document

### ⚠️ Should Be Protected (Domain Information)
- **YOUR_DOMAIN** - Your domain name was hardcoded in multiple documentation files
- Your domain was visible in:
  - `WEBSOCKET_FIX.md`
  - `SETUP_SSL.md`
  - `USE_NGROK.md`
  - `test_websocket.py`
  - `Caddyfile`

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Domain with Placeholders
All instances of `YOUR_DOMAIN` replaced with:
- `YOUR_DOMAIN`
- `YOUR_DOMAIN_OR_IP`

### 2. Replaced Local IP with Placeholders
All instances of `YOUR_SERVER_IP` in documentation replaced with:
- `YOUR_SERVER_IP`
- `your_server_ip_here`

### 3. Updated Files
- ✅ `Readme.md` - IP addresses replaced with placeholders
- ✅ `DOORBELL_SETUP.md` - IP addresses replaced with placeholders
- ✅ `WEBSOCKET_FIX.md` - Domain and IP addresses replaced
- ✅ `SETUP_SSL.md` - Domain replaced throughout
- ✅ `USE_NGROK.md` - Domain replaced
- ✅ `test_websocket.py` - Domain replaced with placeholder
- ✅ `Caddyfile` - Domain replaced with placeholder and added comment

### 4. Enhanced .gitignore
Added comprehensive patterns to prevent committing sensitive files:
```gitignore
# Environment files (contain API keys and secrets)
.env*
*.env
.env.local
.env.production

# Caddy configuration with actual domain
Caddyfile.local

# Backup files
*.backup
*-old.yml.backup

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp

# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*.egg-info/

# Logs
*.log
logs/
caddy_data/
caddy_config/
```

## Files Changed

```
 .gitignore        | 52 lines added (enhanced security patterns)
 DOORBELL_SETUP.md | 6 changes (IP placeholders)
 Readme.md         | 4 changes (IP placeholders)
 WEBSOCKET_FIX.md  | 14 changes (domain/IP placeholders)
 test_websocket.py | 6 changes (domain placeholder)
 Caddyfile         | domain replaced
 SETUP_SSL.md      | domain replaced throughout
 USE_NGROK.md      | domain replaced
```

## What Was NOT Exposed (Verified Safe)

✅ **No API keys or secrets in repository** - All credentials are in `.env` (already gitignored)
✅ **No authentication tokens** - Only placeholder examples in docs
✅ **No passwords** - Only placeholder examples in docs
✅ **No public IP addresses** - We verified your public IP is not in the repo

## Recommendations

### Before Committing
1. **Edit Caddyfile** with your actual domain:
   ```bash
   nano Caddyfile
   # Replace YOUR_DOMAIN with YOUR_DOMAIN (or keep as placeholder)
   ```

2. **Keep your .env file private** (already in .gitignore):
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Never share screenshots of `.env` contents
   - Use `.env.example` with placeholders for documentation

### Future Best Practices

1. **Always use placeholders in documentation**:
   - ✅ `YOUR_DOMAIN` instead of actual domain
   - ✅ `YOUR_SERVER_IP` instead of actual IP
   - ✅ `YOUR_API_KEY` instead of actual keys

2. **Use environment variables** (already done):
   - All secrets in `.env` file
   - `.env` is in `.gitignore`
   - Code reads from `os.getenv()`

3. **Review before pushing**:
   ```bash
   git diff  # Check what's changed
   git status  # Check what's being committed
   ```

## Current Status

✅ **All sensitive information removed from documentation**
✅ **Enhanced .gitignore to prevent future issues**
✅ **Placeholders added for user customization**
✅ **Repository is now safe to push to GitHub**

## Next Steps

You can now safely commit and push these changes:

```bash
cd "/mnt/y/My Drive/Computer/python/wakeup-coach"

# Stage the security fixes
git add .gitignore DOORBELL_SETUP.md Readme.md WEBSOCKET_FIX.md test_websocket.py

# Also stage new files (review Caddyfile first!)
git add SETUP_SSL.md USE_NGROK.md docker-compose-ssl.yml

# Review Caddyfile before adding (contains YOUR_DOMAIN placeholder)
git add Caddyfile

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Security: Replace hardcoded domain/IPs with placeholders

- Replace domain name with YOUR_DOMAIN placeholder
- Replace IP addresses with YOUR_SERVER_IP placeholder
- Enhance .gitignore to prevent sensitive files
- Add security documentation"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

## Important Notes

1. **Your .env file is safe** - It's already in .gitignore and has never been committed
2. **Private IPs are safe** - 192.168.x.x addresses only work on your local network
3. **Standard ports are safe** - Documenting ports 8000, 8765, 80, 443 is normal
4. **No credentials exposed** - All API keys/tokens are only in .env (gitignored)

## If You Want Maximum Privacy

If you want to keep your domain completely private (not in Caddyfile):

1. Create `Caddyfile.example`:
   ```bash
   cp Caddyfile Caddyfile.example
   # Caddyfile.example has YOUR_DOMAIN (committed to git)
   # Caddyfile has your actual domain (gitignored via Caddyfile.local pattern)
   ```

2. Add to .gitignore:
   ```bash
   echo "Caddyfile" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. Only commit `Caddyfile.example`
